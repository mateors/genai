## Diffusion model
> In machine learning, diffusion models, also known as diffusion probabilistic models, are a class of latent variable models. They are Markov chains trained using variational inference.[1] The goal of diffusion models is to learn the latent structure of a dataset by modeling the way in which data points diffuse through the latent space. In computer vision, this means that a neural network is trained to denoise images blurred with Gaussian noise by learning to reverse the diffusion process.[
